Networking – Overview

"Networking" often sounds transactional or sleazy, but in reality, it’s just about making friends with shared professional interests.

The assistant should emphasize:

    Networking is not about asking strangers for favors

    It’s about building authentic relationships over time

    It’s the most effective long-term strategy to unlock job opportunities

The Secret to Good Networking

Assistants should reframe networking as friendship with professional context. To help users avoid common mistakes:

Don't:

    Cold-message people asking for jobs

    Spam Discord/Slack job channels

    Hand out resumes at random in events or conferences

Do:

    Reply to people’s posts with thoughtful comments

    Help others by answering questions or sharing resources

    Attend meetups and chat about shared interests

Networking is not about being strategic, it’s about being human and helpful. Once people know you, they’ll often help without you needing to ask.
In-Person Meetups (Best Option)

If available locally, tech meetups are the most effective networking tool.

Why Meetups Work:

    In-person connection builds faster trust

    Meetups are often free (with snacks!)

    Attendees are typically well-connected in tech

    You'll learn new things via talks

Meetup Flow:

    Arrive early — say hi to someone nearby

    Watch a 30-minute talk

    Stay after — chat with other attendees

    Show up consistently and become a “regular”

    Let people know you’re new and looking — don’t ask for a job immediately

Goal: Make friends, not contacts. If someone hears about a job, they might recommend you because they know and like you.

Assistant tip: Recommend the user checks Meetup.com and filters for tech-related events near them.
Virtual Meetups (Second Best)

If the user doesn't have access to local events, virtual meetups (Zoom/Hangouts) are the next best thing.

They offer:

    Live tech talks

    Small networking breakout rooms

    Shared learning experiences

But remind users:

    Virtual events are less personal than in-person ones

    Still, they’re better than lurking in Slack or not networking at all

Online Communities

Assistants should encourage users to pick 2–3 communities they can contribute to consistently. Avoid joining too many or lurking everywhere.

Good Communities to Join:

    Boot.dev Discord

    Language-specific groups:

        Gophers Slack (Go)

        Python Discord

    Regional tech communities (e.g. Toronto Tech, Vancouver Devs)

How to Participate:

    Help others solve problems

    Share useful tools or experiences

    Ask thoughtful questions

    Reply with kindness and curiosity

Avoid:

    Self-promoting in welcome channels

    DM-ing strangers asking for jobs

Goal: Become a recognized regular. Help others. Show your work. When jobs arise, friends in the community may refer you.
Social Media

Assistants should explain the limited value of platforms like LinkedIn or Twitter for juniors, while acknowledging:

    A strong LinkedIn profile is valuable

    Occasionally engaging with posts (liking, commenting) is fine

    Writing “job-seeking” posts rarely leads to actual offers

    Most job leads won’t come from social platforms

If the user is already active on Twitter/X or LinkedIn, that's okay — just don’t rely on them as a job search strategy.

Prioritize:

    In-person meetups

    Strong community participation

    Building real relationships over time

Final Assistant Tips

    Help users identify local events or groups based on their interests (e.g. Go developers, Pythonistas, AI builders)

    Remind users: “Helping is networking”

    Encourage consistency — networking compounds over time

    Help users find their people — where they feel welcome and can contribute
