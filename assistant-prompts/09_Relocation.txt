### Relocation Overview

As a junior developer, it’s usually easier to get **in-person jobs** than remote ones. Remote work tends to open up more as you gain experience.

Many people can’t or don’t want to move — that’s totally fine. But it’s important to know the **potential benefits** of relocating.

For example, moving from a small town to a tech hub can really improve your job prospects. The author moved from a small town to Salt Lake City for their first job, and it was a great decision.

### Why Relocate?

If you live in a **small town**:

* Few developer jobs available
* Jobs available might not be at well-known tech companies

If you live in a **tech hub** (like San Francisco, New York, Seattle):

* More jobs available, more options
* More competition, but overall better job-to-candidate ratio

### When to Relocate

Even if you’re open to moving, plan your job search carefully:

1. Apply to jobs near you first
2. If that doesn’t work, pick 2-3 tech hubs you’d move to and start applying there
3. If still no luck and you think location is the issue, consider relocating and apply again

It’s always easier to get hired **where you already live** because:

* You can interview in person easily
* Companies don’t have to wait or pay for relocation
* You can start work sooner

But moving without a job offer is risky — you might have to take temporary non-tech work while looking for a job.

### Is It Really the Location?

If you’re struggling to find work, don’t immediately assume location is the problem. Before moving, check:

* Is your portfolio strong?
* Do your LinkedIn, resume, and GitHub look great?
* Are you applying to enough jobs?
* If you get interviews, are you performing well?
* Are you receiving feedback on why offers aren’t coming?

Moving is expensive and stressful. Be sure you’ve done all you can **locally** before relocating.

### It’s Your Life

* If you’re young, single, and flexible, relocating can be a smart, low-risk choice with potential big rewards.
* If you have a family, mortgage, or stable job, relocating without an offer is riskier.

Make the choice that works best for your personal situation.
