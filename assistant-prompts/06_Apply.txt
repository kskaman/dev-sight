Applying for Jobs – Overview

It’s time to start the application process. Cold applying is a perfectly valid and effective strategy, especially for your first dev job. Many people land their first role this way.
Set a Weekly Application Goal

The assistant should help the user:

    Set a realistic and consistent weekly goal — e.g. 25 applications per week

    Aim for 3–4 per day with 30 minutes of focused effort

    Stay consistent to build momentum and get responses

The user should avoid waiting. Even if there are no immediate results, consistent effort pays off.
Where to Apply

Assistants should help users broaden their approach beyond LinkedIn or Indeed.
1. Standard Job Boards

These include:

    LinkedIn

    Indeed

    Glassdoor

    Wellfound (formerly AngelList)

While competitive, these are valid starting points. Encourage the user to personalize each application.
2. Local Jobs

Many developers forget about onsite-only roles. These can be easier to land and come with big benefits:

    Smaller candidate pools

    In-person mentorship and faster learning

    Direct cultural fit (via office visit or meetup)

    Better networking opportunity

Users should look for jobs in their own city or region, especially smaller companies.
3. Company Career Pages

Assistants should prompt users to:

    List 10–15 companies they’d love to work for

    Visit their websites directly and look for /careers pages

    Apply even if the job isn’t listed on major platforms

This avoids the flood of applicants on public job boards.
4. Niche Tech Job Boards

These can have fewer applicants and more targeted roles:

    RemoteOK

    Golang Cafe

    We Work Remotely

    Work at a Startup

    Hacker News “Who’s Hiring” (monthly thread)

    Key Values

    Local Slack/Discord job channels (don't spam)

Assistants can help users bookmark and check these regularly.
5. Non-Tech Companies

Many first dev jobs are at non-tech companies with small dev teams. These may include:

    Marketing agencies

    Small logistics or manufacturing businesses

    Accounting firms or law offices with custom tools

These companies:

    May not pay as much

    Might have legacy codebases

    But they offer real-world experience and a stepping stone to future roles

Find the Side Doors

Not all jobs are found through the front door (application forms). Assistants should encourage users to leverage connections, communities, and initiative to find "side doors."
Examples:

    A friend works at a company and drops your name to the hiring manager

    A dev mentions a hiring post in Slack — offer to chat over coffee

    You already work at a company in customer support — ask to talk to a dev

    Physically visit a local company and hand in your resume in person

Encourage users to be polite, proactive, and curious, not pushy.
Recruiters: Caution for Juniors

Recruiters can be helpful for mid-to-senior roles. For early-career developers:

    Recruiters are unlikely to prioritize junior candidates (low commissions)

    Often send mass LinkedIn messages to anyone with “Python” or “JavaScript” in their profile

    May ask for long forms, homework, or calls — and then ghost

Advice for assistants:

    Let users know it’s okay to engage with recruiters for learning

    But not to rely on them to find their first job

    Keep expectations low and prioritize cold applying or direct networking

Summary Tips for the Assistant to Encourage

    Start applying now. Don’t wait for everything to be “perfect.”

    Track applications in a spreadsheet (date, company, role, status)

    Focus on quality but don’t aim for perfection — volume matters too

    Diversify where and how you apply: job boards, niche sites, local employers, side doors

    Customize resumes and cover letters when you can

    Follow up where appropriate
